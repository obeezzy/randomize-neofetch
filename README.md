# Randomize neofetch

Automagically randomize the linux distro logos displayed in [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) anytime you open the terminal.
This is a simple script I created after stealing the idea from a co-worker.

## Dependencies
[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) must be installed.

## Installation
Simply call script in **.bashrc**.
